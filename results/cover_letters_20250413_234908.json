      "description": "DraftAid is the world's first generative AI for CAD manufacturing drawings, akin to GitHub Copilot but for CAD. It drastically shortens drawing creation time, turning hours into seconds.  \n\nEvery product that is manufactured - from construction to aerospace, automotive, durable goods, and electronics\u2014relies on drawings. Currently, engineers and designers painstakingly make these essential drawings manually. Draftaid streamlines this process saving teams millions in time and quality.  \n\nUsing DraftAid, teams can automate this process with a single click and:  \n- Save considerable time  \n- Direct their focus toward more value-added tasks  \n- Cut down on drawing errors, preventing expensive manufacturing mistakes  \n\nThe problem:  \nModern design teams initiate their design by 3D modeling. To get their design manufactured, they need to make 2D drawings. Making 2D drawings for what\u2019s already been modeled in 3D takes up considerable time and energy. Design teams find themselves stuck investing 40% of their time in this manual task.  \n\nDraftAid streamlines the drafting process making it as effortless as a single click. Once engineers complete their 3D design, a single click swiftly produces a manufacturing-ready 2D drawing within seconds. The resulting drawing is entirely editable, allowing engineers to make adjustments before sending it off for manufacturing.  \n\nDraftAid allows teams to slash their current drawing time by up to 90% and eliminate common drawing errors. This enhances efficiency and ensures consistency in drawings throughout the company."

These folks need access to telematics data to support their end-users who are trucking companies and commercial fleets. Integrating telematics is often a must-have for them and there\u2019s typically a direct correlation between their number of supported integrations and their sales closure rate.  \n\nThe telematics market is fragmented, with hundreds of available platforms, each with their own type of integration (REST, SOAP, etc.), and documentation that is not always available. Companies that need to integrate into these vendors have large integration teams and are still unable to meet their customers' demand.  \n\n\ud83d\udd2e Solution  \nTerminal's Universal API for Telematics enables companies to support all of the leading telematics platforms through a single integration. Similar to Plaid and Stripe - our mission is to increase the innovation velocity of transportation, logistics and fleet management through making fleet data more accessible.  \n\nWe provide a white-labelled User Interface for fleet managers to grant access to telematics data like GPS, vehicle stats, driver hours and safety events.  \n\nOnce a fleet manager grants access, we extract, normalize, enrich, and sync the data for our customer. We also offer common data models, webhooks and access to raw telematics data to make it easy for customers to integrate. You can learn more about how it works in our API Documentation.  \n\nCustomers also receive a Support Portal for managing their integrations, customer connections and data syncs."
